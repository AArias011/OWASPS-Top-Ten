        <h2>
            <li>Injection</li>
        </h2>
        <p>Injections are when untrusted data is tranfered to a code interpreter and placed in a web application.
            Injections occur when code is not validated or filtered. When they occur, hostile data corrupts the
            application and records sensitive data and records. Some ways to prevent Injections are to keep data
            seperate from commands and questions and/or to use a safe API. Being oblivious to them can result in data
            loss, corruption, & disclusure to unauthorized parties.</p>
        <h2>
            <li>Broken Authentication</li>
        </h2>
        <p>Broken Authentication can give attackers the ability to control and compromise an entire system with an
            admin account. Attackers can also access valid usernames and passwords. Broken Authentication occurs when
            a website allows weak credentials and passwords. Some ways to prevent broken authentication are to
            impliment multi-factor authentication to prevent attacks, and to limit password failures and incorrect
            login attempts. Some of the after effects that can hapen because of broken authentication are money
            laundering, social security fraud, & identity theft.</p>
        <h2>
            <li>Sensitive Data Exposure</li>
        </h2>
        <p>Sensitive Data Exposure is when websites don't protect sensitive information which can be used for nefarious
            purposes. When SDE happens, or Sensitive Data Exposure, data transmitted in clear text can cause danggerous
            internet traffic, both internal and external. Sensitive Data Exposure can happen when the user agent (for
            example, email, apps, etc.) doesn't verify if the server certificate is valid.</p>
        <h2>
            <li>XML External Entities (XXE)</li>
        </h2>
        <p>XML External Entities, or XXE, attack against web apps that analyze (XML) input. The attacks happen when the
            web apps accept XML uploads from untrusted sources. One way that the programs can become susceptible to XXE
            attacks is if it uses SOAP prior to the specific version. Some ways to prevent these attacks are for the
            web app to use less complex formats and to avoid serialization of sensitive data. A second prevention act
            is to Patch and upgrade XML processors and libraries used by the application or underlying operating
            system.</p>
        <h2>
            <li>Broken Access Control</li>
        </h2>
        <p>Broken Access Control refers to a system that controls access to inormation or functionality. The ways that
            BAC can occur is by bypassing th access control checks by modifying the URL, internal app, state, or the
            HTML page. They can also use metadate manipluations, relaying and tampering with a JSON web tokem, access
            control token, or a cookie used to manipulate priviledges. Some ways to prevent this is by denying the
            default with exceptions to public resources and for unique application business requirements be met by
            enforced domain models.</p>
