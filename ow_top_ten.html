        <h2>
            <li>Injection</li>
        </h2>
        <p>Injections are when untrusted data is tranfered to a code interpreter and placed in a web application.
            Injections occur when code is not validated or filtered. When they occur, hostile data corrupts the
            application and records sensitive data and records. Some ways to prevent Injections are to keep data
            seperate from commands and questions and/or to use a safe API. Being oblivious to them can result in data
            loss, corruption, & disclusure to unauthorized parties.</p>
        <h2>
            <li>Broken Authentication</li>
        </h2>
        <p>Broken Authentication can give attackers the ability to control and compromise an entire system with an
            admin account. Attackers can also access valid usernames and passwords. Broken Authentication occurs when
            a website allows weak credentials and passwords. Some ways to prevent broken authentication are to
            impliment multi-factor authentication to prevent attacks, and to limit password failures and incorrect
            login attempts. Some of the after effects that can hapen because of broken authentication are money
            laundering, social security fraud, & identity theft.</p>
        <h2>
            <li>Sensitive Data Exposure</li>
        </h2>
        <p>Sensitive Data Exposure is when websites don't protect sensitive information which can be used for nefarious
            purposes. When SDE happens, or Sensitive Data Exposure, data transmitted in clear text can cause danggerous
            internet traffic, both internal and external. Sensitive Data Exposure can happen when the user agent (for
            example, email, apps, etc.) doesn't verify if the server certificate is valid.</p>

            <li>XML External Entities (XXE)</li>
        </h2>
        <p>XML External Entities, or XXE, attack against web apps that analyze (XML) input. </p>
