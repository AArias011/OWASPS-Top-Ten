        <p>Injections are when untrusted data is tranfered to a code interpreter and placed in a web application.
            Injections occur when code is not validated or filtered. When they occur, hostile data corrupts the
            application and records sensitive data and records. Some ways to prevent Injections are to keep data
            seperate from commands and questions and/or to use a safe API. Being oblivious to them can result in data
            loss, corruption, & disclusure to unauthorized parties.</p>
